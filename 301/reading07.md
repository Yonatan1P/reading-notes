A Conversation about REST with my brother

  ## REST
    REST provides a definition of a “resource”
    A web page is a “representation” of a resource.
    1. URLs tell the browser that there's a concept somewhere
    2. browser can then go ask for a specific representation of the concept
    APIs can be used to connect another by accessing URLs
    the URLs are universally agreed upon by all the machines trying to access them
    polymorphism: different nouns can have the same verb applied to them
    HTTP—this protocol Fielding and his friends created—is all about applying verbs to nouns
    you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type
    browsers pretty much just GET stuff
    When a machine GETs the resource, it will ask for the machine readable representation
    you can use APIs to make systems for multiple machines to communicate to each other very easily
    we just tell Rails what we want our data to look like, and it takes care of all of the communication pieces for us

What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team

  ## Team Building
    the bulk of modern work is more and more team-based
    at many companies, more than three-quarters of an employee’s day is spent communicating with colleagues
    studies show that groups tend to innovate faster, see mistakes more quickly and find better solutions to problems
    Studies also show that people working in teams tend to achieve better results and report higher job satisfaction
    profitability increases when workers are persuaded to collaborate more
    teams are now the fundamental unit of organization
    Google’s People Operations department has scrutinized everything from how frequently particular people eat together
    to which traits the best managers share
    there is not a strong pattern between the effectiveness of a team and the team members that comprise it
    The right norms, in other words, could raise a group’s collective intelligence
    on the good teams, members spoke in roughly the same proportion, a phenomenon the researchers referred to as ‘‘equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking.’’
    good teams all had high ‘‘average social sensitivity’’
