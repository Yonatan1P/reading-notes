    Mustache is a specification for a templating language
  definition: is a logic-less template syntax.
  purpose: It can be used for HTML, config files, source code â€” anything
  method: expanding tags in a template using values provided in a hash or object

  ### Using Mustache
    mustache.js is an implementation of mustache templating in JavaScript
    Mustache syntax for placeholder: two braces around {{ name }}
      this is what is going to be replaced when mustache compiles the objects that will go in
    we would write templates according to the Mustache specification
      it can then be compiled by a templating engine
