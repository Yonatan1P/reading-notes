Project Maven that people at google were protesting because they felt that the company's CEO Sundar Pichai was utilizing the powerful AI being developed for autonomous weapons systems for the US military.
After all the outrage and concern raised by employees, Pichai said that Google will still work on government contracts and military contracts as long as it is socially benecial.
Although Google has done the PR part of making claims and appealing to the internationally accepted standards for surveillance and defense. Rather, the AI will generally follow
the principles of international law. Many people were happy with this, but for other this is not nearly a good enough solution. A real question is how close do these principles
allow companies like Google to push up on the boundaries of projects like Project Maven, and will it be ok to live in a world were an AI is sending drone strikes all over the world?

People have been freaking out about the idea that AI will take over the world, and the idea of some monster of our own creation has gone back through history as one of the oldest
tales. Although it is not clear when we hit that distopia, it seems wee may be closer than we expect. there are pre-programmed problems from previous programmers that just stack
problems onto others. We can not be bought and sold for advertisement, and this is making the data about us more valuable that us ourselves for these companies that are out looking
for us. Due to the great collective efforts, and the natural human mistakes that the logic may be riddled with, then there will be constant errors and inefficiencies. These can 
all stack up onto one another, and have cause mounting problems throughout society as a butterfly effect, but it is difficult to explicitly relate the two concepts. It is really
important to focus on the regulations and make sure that there are good rules in place to ensure that our technology develops in an ethical way that progresses in the direction
that we intend.
