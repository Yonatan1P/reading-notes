## JSX

A syntax extension of Javascript used instead of HTML to create and manipulate the DOM

## Rendering Elements

You just use the command render on the REACT DOM

# Components and Props

You can break up your UI into components for greater modularity and repeatability as well as reuseability.

## State and Lifecycle

This tells you how long elements and components are active for and how often they need to have new requests and respond with new information that is updated.

## Handling Events

There are built in event handlers in REACT that can be associated to different components of the UI

### Questions

Is REACT natively in Javascript but imported into Python?

Are there any non-JavaScript based REACT tools?

Why is it now JSX rather than HTML5?
