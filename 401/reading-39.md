https://hackernoon.com/the-best-whiteboard-interview-advice-i-ever-received-3ebbfa72e4a

Ask questions when you get stuck

communicate what you are doing

make sure to explain it as fundamentally as you can, using correct terminology and appropriate jargon (but dont go overboard)

It is even better if you say things before the actual interview to save time with clarifications.

Take your time, and be deligent.

Follow a logical progression and try to make everything make sense.
